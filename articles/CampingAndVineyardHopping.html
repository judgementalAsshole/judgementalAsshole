								<p>Let me preface this article by saying that I'm more of a 'beer drinking, dive bar' kind of guy, but what 
                                    the hell?! I had a crazy hair growing out of my ass and decided to go to the Colorado wine country over 
                                    on the western slope of the state. So, I went westward by my lonesome self like a cowboy riding off into 
                                    the sunset, blah blah blah, clich√© this and that. People were definitely giving me looks of confusion, 
                                    which I understand. I definitely don't fall within the target demographic. Too bad I'm not a smooth talker 
                                    though, because there were a lot of attractive women.</p>
                                <p>Before I digress, here's a table summarizing the boojee booze makers I visited and other trip expenses:</p>

                                    little looser with my spending as the day progressed. <i>Not sure why that was.</i> I'm sure the 
                                    same trip could be done cheaper, especially if one doesn't buy a bottle, or two, at each place... and ate 
                                    packed food and drove a more fuel effiecient vehicle and split the camp reservation with others and so on 
                                    and so forth. Whatever

                                    So the camping spot was really neat. I will say their pricing on their website can a be a bit misleading 
                                    and I recommend calling them up to make your reservation so you get a straightforward quote. I found out 
                                    about this campground by calling up the different wineries and seeing what they recommended. This site was 
                                    a great recommendation, in my opinion, but I say that without having price shopped the other campgrounds. 
                                    What sold me on this one, though, was the location. It is surrounded by some of my favorite vices. There's a 
                                    dispensary (too bad I've recently quit the pot) and winery right next door... and said winery has a concert stage. If vices are not your fancy 
                                    then the natural surroundings might appeal to you more.

                                    itself to some picturesque scenery. At my site I watched a moonrising, which is literally as the name 
                                    implies but it was cooler to watch with mountains and clear skies. The moon was so bright and the skies 
                                    were so clear that the moonlight made the Colorado River sparkle. Tr√®s romantique, non? This campsite would
                                    have been perfect for a couple's getaway. Alas, maybe next time I'll bring an escort.

                                    What was my route like for this impromptu wine hopping tour? Well, 
                                    fortunately for us Google is super creepy and tracks that for me without being asked. So, at least we have
                                    this handy map at the expense of my privacy... hooray invasive surveillance! OK, enough sarcasm from me,
                                    let's get back to talking about the route. Initially, I thought I could walk this. Oh, how naive I was.
                                    Fortunately, someone corrected me of my ignorance and suggested renting an eBike. Boy was I grateful for 
                                    that bit of advice. The town of Palisade is much more spread out than the local brochure map leads on to 
                                    believe.

                                    Some form of transport is highly recommended and apparently there is a thriving pedi-cab industry 
                                    there if you don't want to rent anything. I also saw horse carriage rides and the typical drunk redneck 
                                    driving a diesel-dualy truck if you're feeling adventurous and wanna try hitchhiking (I'm kidding about 
                                    that last one). You got options is my point.

                                    However, I had a lot of fun with the eBike and it saved me from sweating my ass off compared with a non 
                                    electric bike. I believe there's three places in town that do eBike rentals but only one place had one left 
                                    for me. Apparently, it's a popular option so if you consider that, then maybe reserve yours in advance. The 
                                    place I rented from also does paddle boards and a bunch of other stuff. They have a bar so I also imbibed 
                                    in some beer after my wine hopping tour. The shop keeper/bartender was super friendly and knowledgable. She 
                                    gave me a bunch of great recommendations and helped me plan the route I took. One change I would have made 
                                    is to stay closer to the downtown area because that would have saved me more time to visit more wineries.

                                    Oh well, no regrets! because while Maison La Belle Vie winery was a lengthy jaunt on the eBike, their food 
                                    was amazers! So all good suggestions from the kind shop keeper/bartender. She's a chatty kathy, but all great 
                                    conversations. She has fine aspirations to get back to the PNW, and start a kayak rental business which sounds 
                                    like a really fun way to make a living. Don't worry Ms. Shopkeeper, if you're reading this, I won't take your 
                                    idea. Just acknowledging the genius. Furthermore, she was so welcoming that she invited me to the drag 
                                    queen show, which I politely declined because that's not really my scene and I was quite pooped from my day 
                                    of being a wine-o. Maybe another time.

                                    one of the sons of the owners. Don't worry, I didn't get any preferential treatment. They do give you a
                                    little wine glass charm and souvenir wine tasting glass after successfully completing the wine flight, though.
                                    Don't worry it's not tough to complete. The wine is pretty good, in my amateur opinion.

                                    While this winery was one of the fanciest ones I visited that day, it was also one of the more expensive places.
                                    So, there's something to consider, but I would say the location and helpful staff meritted the prices. With 
                                    that said I wouldn't buy a single glass because they come at $20 each, but their canned wine (what a
                                    concept) is really popular and more reasonably priced and quite drinkable. One of them is so drinkable it has 
                                    been nicknamed the <i>patio pounder</i>. What a suggestive name, right? But that makes it all the more

                                    Getting here was a short little scoot on the eBike from Colterris. It's a scenic ride over the bridge, on
                                    the otherside of the Colorado River. Clearly, I deviated from the wine tour theme, since this is a distillery.

                                    However, I made the exception because someone mentioned they have amazing gin, which I do like me a good g&t! 
                                    So, I scoot, scooted over there. The family that owns the distillery have a really cool history. They 
                                    settled in the area after pushing cattle along the Oregon Trail in the late 1800's. Yeah, you remember that 
                                    computer game we used to play in grade school, well this family's ancestors lived it.

                                    So right off the bat I ordered a g&t and much to my enjoyment their gin is a magical color changing gin when 
                                    mixed with citrus because of the butterfly pea infusion. Obviously, I bought a bottle to take home! After the 
                                    g&t, I ordered a flight of moonshine. Yeah baby, you read right. They line up four shots of moonshine in the

                                    flavors of your choosing. They're not harsh and they go down smooth. I tried raspberry, peach, blueberry, and 
                                    prickly pear. Hmmm yummy! I think raspberry was my favorite, but I enjoyed them all. They also serve food 
                                    so you don't have to drink on an empty belly, but I had a large breakfast already so I was still full from that.

                                    I loved the vibe of this place. It was super casual and the wine tasting space was shared with all the
                                    equipment. From the barn patio, where everyone sat to taste their wines, there's epic views of the mountains
                                    overlooking their vineyard. It gave the impression I was wine tasting in the Grand Canyon. They had a huge 
                                    space that accomodated a lot of people. The place was crowded with bachelorette parties and girls trip 
                                    groups dressed their finest (I'm assuming to impress me, but some might say I'm delusional).

                                    Their wine tasting flights are around 15 dollars and you can get up to 6. I got 5, and this is where I was 
                                    introduced to a P√©t-Nat (short for p√©tillant naturel, bet you can't guess what language that is). Anyway, 
                                    I guess these are already pretty popular, but in case you don't know, this is a type of sparkling wine. A 
                                    wilder version of Champagne, if you will. This type of wine kinda reminded me of a boozy kombucha. My
                                    tasting flight had their P√©t-Nat white, P√©t-Nat magenta, P√©t-Nat skins, Gr√ºner Veltliner, and the Reserve 
                                    Red Blend. I liked the P√©t-Nat skins and Reserve Red Blend the most.

                                    I'll be honest I was a little hangry at this point of my self-guided tour. When I had to ask twice for
                                    silverware and water I was a little short with my waitress and the surrounding conversations of the other
                                    patrons sounded like annoying valley-girl babble. It's amazing how a little food in the belly can change

                                    In retrospect, I can understand why they overlooked a lone, single guy like me coming to a winery to do a 
                                    wine tasting. That type of customer -i.e. me- is just not common. They made up for their slight oversight, 
                                    though, and won me over with two glasses of their dessert wines on the house. Oooh, were they good! 
                                    Furthermore, they had the best macarons I have ever eaten outside of France. The lavender macaron was so 
                                    good I wanted to kiss my waitress and have her babies! Weird reaction, I know, but it was that good. 
                                    Definitely come here if you want a wine tasting AND good food.

                                    First impression, I felt like I walked into the winery version of a Cracker Barrel with knick-knacks galore.
                                    I enjoyed it though because this also brought me nostalgia of going on roadtrips when I was younger.
                                    They too had some good P√©t-Nat. My favorite P√©t-Nat of the day came from here. They call it the Aromella. 
                                    It was quite possibly my favorite of the day, which at this point of my tour is saying something after all 
                                    the <i>tasting</i> I had done. My flight here consisted of: Aromella, Palisade Festival, Palisade Ros√©, Palisade Red and Cabernet Sauvignon.

                                    In addition, they did heavy pours on the flights which can't complain
                                    there. But wait, there's more... they had the best price of the day for a flight at 10 bucks! I had my 
                                    reservations about this place, because a few locals didn't have nice things to say. Glad I didn't listen. 
                                    I'm guessing there are rivalries amongst the vintners. I will say they could have used another server because 
                                    the one guy pouring drinks was struggling to keep up with the growing crowd while I was there. Bottom line,
                                    though, come here.

                                    Last review I want to make is more of a token of gratitude to my dad. While on this trip, I reached 
                                    200,000 miles on my truck (got it at 79,000 miles). Reaching this milestone made me think of him because he
                                    got me this truck as a graduation present, and it's carried me many thousands of miles. Without this gift, 
                                    and my dad just being there in my life in general, my life would have been a lot different. So I'm really 
                                    grateful for him and his support throughout my life. Thanks dad, you're an asshole sometimes, but I love you! 
                                    Thanks again for the truck, she still runs great!

                                    All in all I had a lot of fun. Would I do it again? Absolutely! There were a lot of things I wanted to see, but 
                                    didn't have enough time for, like the lavendar farms and the other 20 wineries in the area. However, I would also go to any of the places I already visited a second time.

                                    - were you absolutely bored reading this?<br>
                                    - have you never drank wine before?<br>
                                    - would this article be totally unhelpful in planning for a trip to Palisade?
